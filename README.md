# IcebergEscapades
This game was made as part of a 2020 CodeJam hosted by Kurius. 

# Origins
Base code was made by DogeDude22 and Zack-21-a, with art made by Zack-21-a. You can find that original game here, along with the rest of the Iceberg Escapades project: https://kuriushacks.catrazzy.repl.co/index.html

# How we ended up here
While the game was a very good learning experience, I think it could have been better. So in September 2020, I went back with one goal: Make it close to the vision I had when we set out on this project. Somethings still remain, such as level design and menu art. But there is a whole graphics overhaul and some code improvement, along with a decrease in file size.
